##Namecoin ℕ
Namecoin's typographic symbol (often used to identify a currency) is the mathematical symbol for the [natural numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number#Notation), `ℕ`.  Its typographic name is "double-struck capital n".

Usage
=====

Only these logos should be used as a currency identifier and when branding software.  Competing and modified logos weaken Namecoin's brand-recognition.  For further guidance, see Firefox's excellent [branding guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/identity/firefox/branding/).

We strongly encourage outsider art and wish to promote liberal expression of the Namecoin brand.  However, this should be restricted to artistic expressions which are part of a larger composition: one-off pieces for fundraisers, images accompanying articles about Namecoin, etc.

## License
We have recently suffered from fraudulent software and misinformation spread by cranks and trolls. We intend to release the files under a permissive copy-left license after we have worked out the trademark and copyright issues with some lawyers.  **The vast majority of use-cases are covered by fair-use** and licensing should not be a problem in the interim.

## Modifications
See `HOWTO.md` for information on altering the graphics.
